            <h1>How Does Caffeine Affect Concentration? </h1>

         <p><strong>
         Caffeine is a mild stimulant found not only in coffee but in at least 63 plant species<br> and in pain relievers, diuretics and prescription medications.<br> Because, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports, caffeine stimulates the central <br>nervous system, it is often viewed as a helpful stimulant, <br>thought to increase brain functioning.<br>
            Research has shown that it affects the specific areas of the brain responsible for memory and concentration.</strong></p>

        <h2>Effects on the Brain</h2>
         <p><strong>In a 2005 study by Florian Koppelstätter and colleagues at <br>
            the Medical University at Innsbruck, Austria, fMRI scans determined<br>
            that caffeine promoted increased activity of the anterior cingulate <br>
             and the anterior cingulate gyrus in the prefrontal lobe of the brain.<br> These specific areas are involved in planning, attention, monitoring and<br> concentration, according to this study which was presented at <br>the 2005 meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.<br> Although caffeine has been shown to stimulate concentration, there <br>is inconclusive evidence of how long this effect lasts or precisely<br> how it varies in individuals.</strong></p>
        <h2>Effects on Athletes' Concentration</h2>
             <p><strong>B. Sökmen, L.E.Armstrong and colleagues reported <br>in the "Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research" in 2008 research<br> on the cognitive effects of caffeine on athletes. They found that caffe<br>ine taken before a strenuous training exercise can help sustain exercise<br> <br>intensity and also improve concentration, in particular when the<br> athlete has not had sufficient sleep. This was especially true if the<br> caffeine was taken gradually in small doses over a period of three or <br>four days.
                 Caffeine has also been found to play a role in greater concentration <br>in rifle marksmanship and target detection during simulated combat practice<br> in the military,indicating caffeine can increase<br> concentration to cope with stressful activities.</strong></p>
